## Task №1
Write a program that finds a solution to the quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 using the coprocessor.

## Task №2
The value of the argument x varies from a to b in steps h. For each x, find the values of the function Y(x), the sum S(x) and the number of iterations n at which the required precision ε = |Y(x)-S(x)| is achieved. Print the result in the form of a table. Values a, b, h and ε are entered from the keyboard.
